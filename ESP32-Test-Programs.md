# Test Programs - Blinking LED & PushButton Controlled LED
This document contains the basic programs I created for the sake of testing the ESP32 and getting familiar working with hardware



# Blinking LED

# PushButton Controlled LED

Compounding onto the previous program, we can test input functionality by use of a push-button. 
The desired functionality is that the light will only be enabled so long as the button is pressed,

# Hardware Implementation of Blinking LED

PlatformIO was used to upload the same code onto an ESP-32 device. The following is what the setup of the hardware looked like:
